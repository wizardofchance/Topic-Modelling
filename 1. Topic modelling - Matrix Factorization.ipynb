The great transformations that humanity\\nexperienced during the course of the previous decade,\\nas well as current challenges, demand greater\\nresponsibility on the part of our nations in playing an\\nactive role in the search for urgent solutions to the\\nproblems that are affecting us. This new session of the\\nGeneral Assembly presents us with an excellent\\nopportunity to achieve that goal.\\nToday, the Dominican Republic reaffirms its\\ncommitment to peace, the defence of human rights,\\nsecurity, sustainable development and the\\nstrengthening of democracy \\u2014 pillars of indisputable\\nimportance in safeguarding international peace and\\nstability.\\nThe issue of the reform of the United Nations has\\nbeen on our agenda for a long time. Events of recent\\nyears make it clear that this task must be undertaken as\\na matter of priority. The reform the Security Council is\\nparticularly urgent. Ever since the approval of\\nresolution 47/62 of 11 December 1992, we have been\\nengaged in an ongoing debate on the various reform\\nproposals. Now, however, it is time to act to restructure\\nthe Council so as to make it more representative and\\nequitable, as well as more transparent in its decision-\\nmaking, thereby strengthening its legitimacy as the\\nguarantor of international peace and security.\\nTerrorism has emerged as an ongoing threat to\\nhumanity. Uncertainty and pain have characterized the\\nbeginning of the twenty-first century. Our nations have\\nthe challenge of fighting together, at a global level,\\nagainst the proliferation of weapons of mass\\ndestruction and in favour of equitable development and\\nfree societies. Security problems call for decisive\\naction against international terrorism, organized crime\\nand the illegal trade in arms and drugs.\\nThe Millennium Summit established as one of its\\nmain goals the reduction of poverty by 50 per cent by\\n2015. Notwithstanding some progress in the\\nachievement of those goals, poverty remains a terrible\\nscourge. The Dominican Government, which considers\\nthat issue to be one of great importance, has created a\\nSocial Cabinet to act as a coordinating mechanism for\\nall governmental institutions for social welfare, and is\\nhelping to ensure that both national and international\\nresources are distributed equitably and allocated to\\nregions that require social investment.\\nAll countries must join efforts, accepting\\nresponsibilities, both shared and separate, to guarantee\\nthat growth and poverty do not go together and that, in\\nmeeting the needs of the present generation, we do not\\ncause the destruction of future generations\\u2019 capacity to\\nmeet their own needs.\\nThe positive outcome of the Fourth Ministerial\\nConference of the World Trade Organization, held in\\nDoha, Qatar, in November 2001, and of the\\nInternational Conference on Financing for\\nDevelopment held in Monterrey, Mexico, in March\\n2002, was a key element for achieving millennium\\ndevelopment goals. The Doha Development Agenda\\nand the Monterrey Consensus provided a framework to\\nfacilitate market access, improve multilateral\\nregulations for channelling globalization and increase\\nfinancial aid for development.\\nHowever, we must mention what happened at the\\nFifth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\\nOrganization (WTO) recently held in Canc\\u00fan, Mexico.\\nAlthough agreement was not reached because of\\nfundamental differences in the positions regarding\\nessential world trade issues, we are convinced that this\\nwill not affect the multilateral system of negotiations.\\nOn the contrary, some member states maintain that this\\nimpasse may even be necessary to shape more\\nequitable international agreements at the heart of the\\nWTO. What is an important issue is not to lose the\\ndevelopment perspective within the work programme\\nof the WTO, as set in the Doha Development Agenda,\\nbecause that agenda includes the aspirations of millions\\nof people around the world, whose hope for progress\\nlies in the opportunities of the global economy.\\nThe position of the Dominican Government with\\nregard to the Middle East conflict is based primarily on\\nunconditional adherence to the norms and principles of\\ninternational law, particularly those related to the\\npeaceful solution of disputes; condemning the use of\\nforce and terrorism in all its forms; complying in good\\nfaith with international treaties; and on strict\\nobservance of resolutions of the United Nations and its\\ndeliberative bodies.\\nDevoted to these principles, the Dominican\\nRepublic has, in response to the humanitarian appeals\\n17\\n\\nof the Security Council, participated in the efforts to\\nrebuild Iraq, in order to contribute to the development\\nof a secure and stable environment in which the\\nsovereignty of the Iraqi people may be restored.\\nSimilarly, our country supports the peace process\\noutlined in the road map submitted by the United States\\nof America and endorsed by the Russian Federation,\\nthe United Nations and the European Union. We\\nunderstand that a cessation of violence cannot be\\npostponed, along with the historic pledges of all parties\\nto make sacrifices to promote a lasting solution to the\\nconflict and peaceful coexistence.\\nDrawing up sustainable development policies\\ncalls for dealing with problems before they emerge.\\nThis implies making headway in achieving the\\nmillennium development goals, particularly on crucial\\nissues such as energy and protection of the\\nenvironment. In this respect, our nation reiterates its\\nrejection of the international maritime transport of\\nradioactive and toxic waste, a position which has been\\nexpressed in other international forums. This issue is\\nlinked to international security.\\nThe importance of guaranteeing women equal\\nrights and equity, and promoting their increased\\npolitical participation, has been a continuous concern\\nof the heads of State in various international forums.\\nThe International Research and Training Institute for\\nthe Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), the only\\ninstitution within the United Nations system dedicated\\nexclusively to that end, has its headquarters in Santo\\nDomingo, capital of the Dominican Republic. The\\nDominican Government calls upon Member States to\\ncontinue supporting the work of INSTRAW in the\\nDominican Republic by providing contributions, to the\\nextent that they can.\\nOur country commends the culture of peace, and\\nis making efforts to ensure that at the primary level\\nchildren are taught about promoting mutual\\nunderstanding and learn about civics and human rights.\\nSimilarly, we believe that a solid and permanent\\ndemocracy is an achievable goal. The challenges here\\nare clear: growing democracy, more respect for civic\\nrights, freedom of the press; freedom of expression of\\npolitical parties and public opinion; dignity and\\ntransparency of all leaders and the moral legitimacy of\\nall.\\nDeeply concerned about the spread of HIV/AIDS\\nin our nation, the Government has made great efforts to\\ncomply with the commitments entered into in the\\nDeclaration on fighting this terrible disease. We call for\\nincreased international cooperation and efforts to\\nguarantee the availability of drugs at affordable prices,\\nbased on the Doha Declaration on intellectual property\\nand the right to health.\\nThe Dominican Republic salutes with optimism\\nthe role played by the United Nations and the\\nOrganization of American States (OAS) in efforts to\\ndevelop humanitarian aid programmes for the Haitian\\npeople. It is imperative to stress here the need for\\ngreater support from the international community for\\nour neighbouring republic of Haiti and its neglected\\npopulation.\\nAlthough we are aware that this issue has been\\nexcluded from the agenda of the current session , we\\nwish to state our support for the aspirations of the\\nRepublic of China, Taiwan, to rejoin this Organization,\\nof which it was a Member for many years. Our position\\nis in line with the universal principles contained in the\\nCharter, the basis of the rules of international law and\\nthe historical tradition of friendly relations with\\nTaiwan.\\nOn behalf of the Dominican Government, Sir,\\nmay I congratulate you on your election as President,\\nconfident that your conduct of this session will be\\nsuccessful, beneficial for the international community\\nand a source of pride to your country, Saint Lucia, and\\nthus to our Caribbean community.\\nI also wish to express the Dominican\\nGovernment\\u2019s rejection of the barbaric act perpetrated\\nagainst the United Nations Mission in Baghdad on 19\\nAugust, and to reiterate to the families of Mr. Sergio\\nVieira de Mello and of the other deceased colleagues\\nour most heartfelt condolences.\\nWe are all aware of the great challenges\\nconfronting humanity. Our future depends on the\\nactions we take now. We have the opportunity to meet\\nthe expectations of the nations of the world. Let us take\\nup this challenge with all due responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"For the Haitian delegation, the assumption of the presidency\\nof the General Assembly by, for the first time ever, a\\nrepresentative of the Caribbean is a source of pride and\\nsatisfaction. I should like to convey to you, Mr. President,\\nthe warm congratulations of the President, the Government\\nand the people of the Republic of Haiti on your unanimous\\nelection and their best wishes for success in your\\nendeavours. Your selection is undoubtedly a manifestation\\nof the well-founded acknowledgement of your eminent\\npersonal qualities and rich diplomatic experience, and also\\nattests to the growing role of your country, the Republic of\\nGuyana, in international relations.\\nI wish also to congratulate your predecessor, Mr.\\nStoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, who successfully directed the\\nAssembly\\u2019s work at its forty-seventh session.\\nThis is also an opportunity for me to express our\\nprofound appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\\nBoutros-Ghali, for his remarkable efforts in the cause of\\npeace and for the new dynamics that he has stamped on the\\nOrganization.\\nAs the century draws to a close, history is being made\\nat a remarkable pace. Every day there are important events\\nthat put international life on a new course because of the\\nprofound impact they have on the destiny of peoples. It\\nseems to us that, at the dawn of the third millennium, the\\nworld is seeking new direction. Respect for the person, the\\nneed for democracy and fundamental freedoms and the\\nclimate of peace to which peoples throughout the world\\naspire: these concepts are taking concrete form in major\\nevents that attract our attention today. In the search for a\\nnew dimension to give to peace, leaders in various parts of\\nthe world have begun a dialogue that, in the past, was\\nthought impossible.\\nThis is the case in the Middle East, where, after\\ndecades of hostility, Israelis and Palestinians have embarked\\non the path to a historic rapprochement, which we hope will\\nbe of benefit to the two peoples and the entire region.\\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 9\\nLikewise, recent developments in South Africa -\\nnotably the establishment of the Transitional Executive\\nCouncil and the announcement that free elections are to be\\nheld on 27 April 1994 on the basis of universal suffrage -\\nsignal the long-awaited building of a multi-racial, democratic\\nand united society.\\nFollowing two decades of civil war, Cambodia is at last\\nexperiencing a period of peace. This has made possible the\\nholding of democratic general elections and the\\nestablishment of a legitimate Government.\\nAfter 12 years of armed conflict, El Salvador, with the\\nsigning of the Mexico Agreements, is moving towards the\\nconsolidation of peace.\\nWe must note that, in all continents, considerable\\nprogress is being made in the search for peace, although the\\nexistence of hotbeds of tension of all types - fuelled by,\\namong other factors, racial, ethnic, tribal or clan\\ndifferences - indicates that dialogue, which alone can ensure\\nharmonious human coexistence, is not always achieved\\nspontaneously.\\nThe United Nations has played a decisive role in the\\nmediation aimed at securing a negotiated settlement of these\\ncrises. We support the Secretary-General\\u2019s sustained efforts\\nto contribute to the process of bringing peace to these\\npeoples, whose pain, privation and distress resonate deeply\\nin the hearts of the Haitian people. There is no doubt that\\nthe concepts of preventive diplomacy, maintenance of peace,\\nrestoration of peace and peace building that are developed in\\nthe Secretary-General\\u2019s 'Agenda for Peace' are guiding\\nprinciples for this Organization in its action to guarantee\\ninternational peace and security.\\nBut, in order to meet the diverse challenges confronting\\nit and to respond to the expectations placed in it, the United\\nNations must adapt to a new reality and must have adequate\\nmeans to do so. In this context, the Haitian delegation\\nsupports the process of reform and restructuring aimed at\\nincreasing the Organization\\u2019s effectiveness. We believe that\\nUnited Nations activities in the field of economic and social\\ndevelopment should be given at least as much attention as\\nthat accorded to peace-keeping operations.\\nUnquestionably, the 'Agenda for Peace' provides the\\nOrganization with a point of reference, which enables us to\\napproach the problems of peace in a global environment that\\nis in a state of change and compels us to reflect on the\\nquestion of what constitutes the very foundations of peace.\\nSome say that peace is indissociably related to democracy\\nand development. We share this view. Without peace, there\\ncan be no development, and, without development and\\nrespect for human rights, one cannot expect social peace.\\nMy Government, which was established as a result of\\nthe Governors Island Agreements, believes that the\\nfundamental principles proclaimed in the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights and in the Haitian Constitution\\nshould be constantly in our minds, motivating us to provide\\nall the better for the well-being of our people.\\nFor two years the Haitian people has been waging an\\nearnest and constant struggle for the restoration of\\ndemocracy in Haiti and of the fundamental rights that were\\nstolen from it in the coup d\\u2019\\u00e9tat of 30 September 1991.\\nToday, thanks to the constant support of the international\\ncommunity, we are on the eve of turning this painful page\\nin the history of our country. In this respect, we should like\\nto express warm thanks to the Special Envoy of the United\\nNations Secretary-General and the Organization of American\\nStates for his inestimable achievement. We hope that we\\nshall be able to continue to cooperate with him towards\\nsecuring a definitive settlement of the Haitian crisis.\\nAs members know, the Governors Island Agreement\\nwas signed on 3 July 1993. That instrument sets the\\nmodalities for the restoration of constitutional order and\\ndemocracy in Haiti.\\nOn 30 August a Prime Minister, chosen in accordance\\nwith our Constitution, took office, and a consensus\\nGovernment was established. The economic measures that\\nhad been adopted by the Security Council were suspended,\\nand they will be lifted definitively at the end of the\\ntransitional process. Technical assistance, to strengthen the\\ninstitutions and to consolidate democracy, is taking shape\\nthrough the United Nations Mission in Haiti, which is\\nalready beginning to be deployed.\\nWith a view to fostering national reconciliation,t h e\\nPresident of the Republic has granted an amnesty in respect\\nof political offences committed during the period of the coup\\nd\\u2019\\u00e9tat.\\nOther steps remain to be taken before October 30, when\\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the\\ndemocratically elected President, returns to Haiti to take up\\nagain the mandate conferred upon him by the Haitian people.\\nNone the less, recent events, characterized by an\\nupsurge of violence, greatly discredit the political will of the\\nother party to respect scrupulously all the terms of the\\nGovernors Island Agreement and the New York Pact. Just\\na few hours ago, armed groups demonstrated at Port-au-\\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\\nPrince to oppose the arrival of the members of the technical\\nmission of the United Nations. The national radio station\\nwas under assault by armed individuals manifestly opposed\\nto a peaceful settlement of the crisis. Such behaviour clearly\\njeopardizes the success of the Governors Island Agreement.\\nThe setting up of such institutionalized mechanisms of\\nviolence and intimidation by factions opposing the\\nestablishment of democracy and the growing number of\\nhuman-rights violations worry us, because they reveal the\\ndeliberate bad faith of institutions whose function it is\\nprecisely to safeguard security and our citizens\\u2019 exercise of\\ntheir rights.\\nAware that this situation cannot go on, we send out\\nfrom this rostrum a sincere appeal to all those who wish in\\ngood will to build a better life today and a better future for\\nthe children of Haiti and to give to our country an\\nopportunity to renew its path of progress. We also appeal to\\nthe international community to maintain its pressure so that\\nthe minority forces opposing the democratic aspirations of\\nthe Haitian people will find themselves completely isolated\\nand so that they will have no choice other than dialogue and\\nreconciliation.\\nThe return of constitutional order in Haiti is part of the\\ngenuine international political plan for which we have\\nfought, and it symbolizes at the same time an effort for a\\ndemocratization process in Haiti and, at the world level, the\\ntriumph of law, supported by the moral solidarity of the\\ninternational community.\\nThe free and honest elections of 16 December 1990,\\nwhich brought President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power,\\nrepresent the country\\u2019s first democratic experience since its\\nindependence, the first application of the Haitian\\nConstitution of 1987 and, above all, the first step towards\\nguaranteeing the rights of the citizen. Our experiences over\\nthe past two years have convinced us that the protection of\\ndemocracy and fundamental rights is a cause that transcends\\nour national borders and takes on an international dimension.\\nThe return of constitutional order in Haiti will be a\\nvictory of the State and the rule of law over totalitarianism\\nand imposture, an ongoing struggle that unites us all and\\nmakes it possible for us to confront those who jeopardize\\npeace.\\nWe know that in the absence of democracy and,\\ntherefore, in the absence of the institutions and structures of\\nthe rule of law, the protection of human rights would be\\nquixotic and ineffectual, especially in my country. This\\ndemocracy requires real participation, pluralistic and\\ntransparent. This democracy, in our view, cannot mean only\\nthe holding of periodic elections; it means, rather, a\\ncollective way of life in an adapted economy.\\nThe invaluable support of the international community\\nwill make possible the return of constitutional order in my\\ncountry, and we shall apply all our national resources to the\\nconstruction of a State where the rule of law genuinely\\nprevails, a State that does not content itself merely with\\nguaranteeing public freedoms, but that also seeks to promote\\nequality and solidarity. This is the challenge we shall try to\\nmeet, because we firmly believe that a State in which all its\\nchildren cannot live because of dictatorship and barbarism is\\nunacceptable at the dawning of the twenty-first century.\\nThe political stakes the international community must\\nface are compounded by economic, social and cultural\\nchallenges. Poverty, ignorance and the scourge of disease\\nare still negative factors threatening the very cohesion of\\nStates and continuing to cause gross imbalances in the\\ncountries of the South, especially the least developed among\\nthem. An unbridled imitation of Western models has led\\nsome countries to ignore almost completely the value of\\ntheir heritage of creativity and wisdom and their enterprising\\nspirit. The result is the absence of a cultural dimension of\\ndevelopment and a lack of participation by an important\\nsector of their societies: the most impoverished sector,\\nwhich is unable to protest, or to protect its own interests, a\\nsector made up especially of women, children and the\\nmasses of disenfranchised poor.\\nEfforts have been made at the national, regional and\\ninternational levels. A certain amount of progress has been\\nachieved. In spite of all that, the values proposed -\\nentrepreneurship, growth, profit and so on - remain\\ninaccessible to the great majority of people living in the\\ncountries of the South. This poses a grave threat to one of\\nthe very cornerstones of human rights: the right to\\ndevelopment.\\nDay by day the world is becoming increasingly\\ninterdependent and, in a sense, increasingly integrated. We\\nare confronting a profound transition that promises to be\\ncomplex and hazardous. We must do our best so that this\\nglobalization, this world economy, will not further widen the\\ngap between North and South. The absence of an equitable\\nsystem is being felt increasingly. The South remains in a\\nposition of subordination and dependence which prevents it\\nfrom managing this new world order well. Global initiatives\\nare indeed necessary. As we approach the twenty-first\\ncentury a profound reform of the international system,\\nparticularly in the fields of trade, finance and technology,\\nhas become vitally important. I do mean profound reform,\\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 11\\na reform that will bring about a restructured dialogue\\nbetween North and South; a reform that will lead to viable\\nand sustainable economic growth for the countries of both\\nNorth and South, a growth which will be measured not only\\nby growth in gross national product but also by certain social\\nand political achievements; the access by all without any\\ndiscrimination to fundamental services such as food, health-\\ncare, housing and appropriate education; and access to a\\ndemocratic form of government and effective system of\\njustice to protect all the people.\\nLasting, bold and courageous solutions must be found\\nif we truly want to lift the barriers that prevent the economic\\ndevelopment of the group of countries to which we belong.\\nThe questions of debt, delays in the flow of technology,\\nof capital, and of direct investment to the countries of the\\nSouth, the constant decline in the prices of commodities,\\nworsening access to markets and deterioration in the terms\\nof trade are all questions that need to be discussed seriously\\nby the international community if we are to arrive at a better\\nbalanced, new international economic order.\\nThe Republic of Haiti, which over the past two years\\nhas experienced a situation that the Security Council\\ndescribed as unique and exceptional, is now at a crossroads.\\nIn order to restore the process of democracy and the rule of\\nlaw in the country the population of Haiti and its legitimate\\nGovernment have made enormous sacrifices. These\\nsacrifices, together with a long history of corruption, denial\\nof rights, and plundering, have led to disaster at the\\neconomic, social and environmental levels. Whole sectors\\nof national production have been destructured and the\\nenvironment has been dramatically affected. The social cost\\nof a return to democracy is extremely high and has therefore\\nin advance jeopardized all future endogenous development\\nefforts.\\nThat is why we ask for the unfailing support and\\nbacking of the international community, which, we feel,\\nshould in the short-, medium- and long-term involve\\nsubstantial, increased and strengthened technical and\\nfinancial cooperation.\\nThe time has come to transform the vast upsurge of\\nsolidarity which we have seen in the course of the past two\\nyears, into a powerful, concerted effort at open, fruitful and\\nsubstantially enhanced cooperation.\\nThe Organization, better than anyone, is aware of the\\nbreadth of the challenges today confronting the Government\\nof Haiti. It would be futile to hope for a strengthening of\\nthe rule of law, which remains our priority objective, if we\\nare not able rapidly to alleviate the enormous distress facing\\nthe overwhelming majority of the Haitian people.\\nWe want to be assured that today as in the past the\\nOrganization will continue to stand by us at this crucial\\nstage, as a result of which socio-economic conditions should\\nbe substantially improved in a Haiti that is reconciled with\\nitself and in which rights and freedoms flourish.\\nWhile we recognize that no price can be placed on\\npeace we do believe that it requires dialogue and\\nreconciliation, without which the process of transition cannot\\nlead to lasting democracy.\\nThe fashioning of a new world has been the shared\\nresponsibility of us all since the founding of the\\nOrganization in 1945. At the San Francisco Conference the\\nHaitian delegation, imbued with the historic responsibility of\\nbeing the first black republic in the world, had understood,\\nabove and beyond the inspiration of the day which led to the\\nestablishment of the United Nations, that the Organization\\nrepresented an opportunity not only for our island nation but\\nalso for all responsible countries that would join this\\ncommunity of nations.\\nWe want to take this opportunity to extend a warm\\nwelcome to the new Member States and we hope that the ad\\nhoc committee which is to study the question of Taiwan will\\nfind a solution that is satisfactory to all the parties\\nconcerned, in keeping with the fundamental principles of\\ninternational law.\\nLet us take the tremendous opportunity being given to\\nus today to build the new world that generations of men and\\nwomen are awaiting; let us take this opportunity to help each\\nother by establishing a continuous dialogue between North\\nand South in order to find urgent responses and solutions to\\nthe problem of underdevelopment and poverty, that ailment\\nof our century which has shaken mankind. May dialogue\\nbecome our password.\\n\",\n          \"The Holy See is\\nhonoured to take part in the general debate of the\\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations for the first\\ntime since the Assembly adopted resolution 58/314 on\\n1 July 2004, which formalized and specified the rights\\nand prerogatives of its status as a Permanent Observer,\\na status which the Holy See has enjoyed since 1964.\\nIt is therefore my pleasant duty to express sincere\\ngratitude to all the Member States. In approving the\\naforesaid resolution, they signalled once again the\\nparticular bond of cooperation between the Apostolic\\nSee and the United Nations, already underlined by\\nPope John Paul II on his first visit to this Assembly\\nexactly 25 years ago. In this significant circumstance, I\\nam honoured to convey to you, Sir, and to all of you\\ngathered here to represent your noble countries, the\\nrespectful and cordial greetings of Pope John Paul II. I\\nbring a special greeting to the Secretary-General of the\\nUnited Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and also to his\\nworthy assistants. Their work, as recorded in the\\nannual report of the Secretary General (A/59/1) with\\nreference, above all, to conflict prevention and\\npeacekeeping in the world, deserves the appreciation\\nand gratitude of us all.\\nSeveral of the themes included in the agenda of\\nthe General Assembly may be considered essential for\\nattaining the supreme objective of peace and for the\\nfuture of humanity. To quote only a few: the United\\nNations and a new global human order; pursuit of the\\nMillennium Goals; total and general disarmament;\\nglobalization and interdependence; international\\nmigration and development; human rights; and human\\ncloning. I shall limit myself to a brief presentation of\\nthe Holy See\\u2019s position regarding some of those issues.\\nAmong the Millennium Goals, pride of place\\ngoes to the theme of poverty and development. I say\\npride of place, because it concerns the right to\\nsubsistence of hundreds of millions of human beings,\\nsurviving \\u2014 as best they can \\u2014 below the threshold of\\nwhat is necessary, as well as tens of millions of\\nundernourished children unjustly deprived of the right\\nto live.\\nIn order to find a lasting solution to those\\ninhumane conditions, it is necessary to progress, under\\nthe aegis of the United Nations, towards a more\\nflexible and more just international trade system.\\nFurthermore, financial structures are needed which\\nfavour development and the cancellation of foreign\\ndebt for the poorest countries. Likewise, the results of\\nscientific research and technology must be generously\\nshared, especially in the field of health.\\nOn that matter I need say no more, since the Holy\\nSee\\u2019s position has already been presented once again\\nby the Cardinal Secretary of State, at the conference on\\nhunger and poverty held in New York on\\n20 September. I repeat only this: the urgency of the\\nsituation cannot tolerate delay. It is a question of\\njustice.\\nOf immediate relevance to the supreme good of\\npeace is the theme of total and general disarmament. If\\nit is true that the production and sale of arms to other\\ncountries endangers peace, it follows that severe and\\neffective international controls are needed. The\\ncommitment of the United Nations in that area is\\nattested to by the various conventions it has supported\\nwith reference to weapons of mass destruction as well\\nas conventional weapons. But we are only at the\\nbeginning of a long process, with huge economic\\ninterests as obstacles along our path towards peace.\\nThe problem of weapons of mass destruction is\\nclearly to be distinguished from that of conventional\\nweapons; but the latter have a terrible and unending\\ncontemporary relevance in the numerous armed\\nconflicts that stain the world with blood, and also in\\nterrorism.\\nRegional armed conflicts are so numerous that\\nthere is no time to list them all. However, there are\\nsome that I cannot omit to mention. Above all there is\\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict is not\\nsimply contained within the narrow territorial\\nboundaries of the region itself. Those directly involved\\nare the Israeli Government and the Palestinian\\nAuthority, and they have the grave duty to demonstrate\\ntheir desire for peace. With this end in view, a road\\nmap has been drawn up and formally accepted by both\\nparties; may they proceed along it with determination\\nand courage.\\n26\\n\\nBut that conflict is also followed with intense\\ninterest and often with passion by large sections of\\nhumanity. The Catholic Church, present in Palestine\\nfor 2,000 years, invites all concerned to turn their\\nbacks on any action likely to destroy confidence and to\\nutter generous words of peace and make bold gestures\\nof peace. And if peace is the fruit of justice, let it not\\nbe forgotten \\u2014 as Pope John Paul II has reminded\\nus \\u2014 that there can be no justice without forgiveness;\\nindeed, without mutual forgiveness.\\nThen there is the Iraqi conflict. The position of\\nthe Holy See concerning the military action of 2002-\\n2003 is well known. Everyone can see that it did not\\nlead to a safer world either inside or outside Iraq. The\\nHoly See believes it is now imperative to support the\\npresent Iraqi Government in its efforts to bring the\\ncountry to normality and to a political system that is\\nsubstantially democratic and in harmony with the\\nvalues of its historic traditions.\\nThe Holy See is gravely concerned about various\\nAfrican countries scarred by bloodshed arising from\\nmutual conflicts and even more from internal strife.\\nThey need active international solidarity: more\\nspecifically, and connaturally, the African Union needs\\nto intervene authoritatively so as to bring all legitimate\\ninterested parties around a negotiating table. The\\nAfrican Union has already demonstrated its ability to\\nact successfully in some cases: it deserves recognition\\nand support.\\nI have mentioned the theme of terrorism, an\\naberrant phenomenon, utterly unworthy of man, which\\nhas already assumed global dimensions: today no State\\ncan presume to be safe from it. Hence, it seems\\nobvious that terrorists can be effectively challenged\\nonly through a concerted, multilateral approach,\\nrespecting the ius gentium, and not through a policy of\\nunilateralism. No one is in any doubt that the fight\\nagainst terrorism means, first and foremost,\\nneutralizing its active breeding grounds. But the\\nunderlying causes are many and complex: political,\\nsocial, cultural, religious; for this reason, what is still\\nmore important is long-term action, directed, with\\nforesight and patience, at its roots, designed to stop its\\nspreading further and to extinguish its deadly\\ncontagious effects.\\nThe Holy See, and the entire Catholic Church, is\\nactively involved in this work. It is involved through\\nits educational and charitable institutions, which,\\nwherever they are, are committed to raising the cultural\\nand social levels of the populations, without any\\ndiscrimination, especially on religious grounds; it is\\ninvolved through interreligious dialogue, which has\\ngrown in intensity ever since the Second Vatican\\nEcumenical Council. The Holy See will always be\\ngrateful to the authorities of other religions that\\ndemonstrate openness to such dialogue, and also to the\\ncivil authorities that encourage it, without any political\\ninterference, respecting the distinction between the\\nreligious and the civil sphere and the fundamental\\nhuman right to freedom of religion.\\nThe right to freedom of religion is sanctioned,\\ntogether with other fundamental rights, in the\\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by\\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations on\\n10 December 1948. Such fundamental human rights\\nstand or fall together. And man stands or falls with\\nthem.\\nFor this reason, every effort has to be made to\\ndefend them in all fields. For this to happen, one\\nparticular danger must be avoided, which is found\\ntoday in various countries and social settings. It is the\\nidea that these fundamental human rights, as\\nsanctioned by the Universal Declaration, are\\nexpressions of a particular culture and are therefore\\nhighly relative. No, at heart, they are expressions of the\\nhuman being as such, even if the fact remains that, at\\ndifferent times and in different cultures, they may have\\nbeen and may still be differently applied, in more or\\nless adequate and acceptable ways.\\nAmong the fundamental rights, or rather foremost\\namong them, as the Universal Declaration explicitly\\nstates, is the right to life of every individual. The Holy\\nSee could say a great deal about the right to life of\\nevery individual, because the essence of its message is\\nthe gospel of life.\\nThe question of human cloning comes under the\\nsame broad heading. In a few weeks, this General\\nAssembly will resume its debate on human cloning. In\\nthis respect, the Holy See is pleased to reaffirm its\\ncommitment to support the advancement of medical\\nscience, conducted always in a manner that respects\\nhuman dignity, because it offers healing and cures for\\nvarious diseases. With this end in view, the Holy See\\nreiterates its support for the procurement and use of\\nadult stem cells and believes that the way forward is to\\n27\\n\\ndraw up and implement a clear convention that will\\nresult in a comprehensive ban on human cloning.\\n\\u201cWhereas recognition of the inherent dignity and\\nof the equal and inalienable rights of all members\\nof the human family is the foundation of freedom,\\njustice and peace in the world,\\u201d\\nSo begins the preamble to the Universal Declaration of\\nHuman Rights. It is one of the many undeniable merits\\nof the United Nations to have proposed to the\\nconscience of all humanity, more than 50 years ago,\\nthese secure principles for progress towards peace.\\nOver the years, however, the United Nations has\\nneeded to adapt its procedures to take account of\\ndevelopments on the world political scene so that its\\nwork for the promotion of peace can become more\\neffective. The first results of the high-level commission\\nset up for this purpose by Secretary-General Kofi\\nAnnan were published last June. The Holy See will be\\nable to offer some explicit evaluation on the occasion\\nof the debate on the subject to be held next week.\\nFor now, I should simply like to recall Pope John\\nPaul II\\u2019s words for this year\\u2019s International Day of\\nPeace. He reminded us that humanity today is in a new\\nand more difficult phase of its genuine development,\\nand he called for a greater degree of international\\nordering. This could be brought about by giving\\norganizations like the United Nations special\\nprerogatives to facilitate action to prevent conflicts at\\ntimes of international crisis, and also, when absolutely\\nnecessary, humanitarian intervention \\u2014 that is, action\\naimed at disarming the aggressor.\\nYet, the greater degree of international ordering\\ncould be achieved still more effectively if the United\\nNations were to rise to the status of a moral centre,\\nwhere all nations of the world feel at home and\\ndevelop a shared awareness of being, as it were, a\\nfamily of nations.\\nNow and in the future, the United Nations can\\ncount on the Holy See to be not only an attentive\\nPermanent Observer, but also a travelling companion,\\never ready to support its complex and difficult activity,\\nand also to collaborate in a spirit of freedom and\\nfriendship with all the Member States.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

We \\nwish you every success and assure you of our fullest \\ncooperation.\\n\\nAt a time when the world is facing multiple \\nchallenges, there is renewed attention to the role of \\nthe United Nations in advancing international peace, \\nsecurity and prosperity. However, never has scepticism \\nabout the capacity of the United Nations to do so been \\nhigher, or the external environment less propitious for \\nmultilateralism.\\n\\nThe nearly seven decades of work of the United \\nNations hold one simple lesson: that we are most \\nsuccessful when we adhere to the letter and spirit of \\nthe United Nations Charter, basing our decisions on the \\nwidest possible consensus and balancing equitably the \\nneeds and responsibilities of nations at different stages \\nand levels of development.\\n\\nIn those seven decades, the world has changed in \\nfundamental ways. Asia and Africa are independent \\nand resurgent. Countries are now not only more \\ninterdependent, but also face new, increasingly complex \\nchallenges. For multilateralism to remain relevant and \\neffective in the future, multilateral institutions need to \\nbe reformed urgently. The place to begin is right here.\\n\\nThe Security Council must be reformed and \\nrestructured to reflect current political realities. \\nMore developing countries should be included as both \\npermanent and non-permanent members.\\n\\nThe multilateral financial institutions should also \\nenable an enhanced voice for developing countries in \\ntheir decision-making structures. Multilateral efforts \\nmust guide our quest for peace and security, wherever \\nthey are threatened, and the centrality and contribution \\nof the United Nations system to development must be \\nrestored.\\n\\nThose objectives require the building of a new \\ninternational consensus suited to our time and rooted \\nin today\\u2019s realities. It is only such a plan of action that \\nwill enable the United Nations to meet the twin tests of \\nlegitimacy, and effectiveness and efficiency.\\n\\nWe commend your choice of the theme of this \\nsession. Setting the stage for the post-2015 development \\nagenda is especially important as we deal with a \\nlingering global economic slowdown and continuing \\nvolatility in financial markets. These have imposed \\ndisproportionately heavy costs on developing countries \\nand the vulnerable groups within them.\\n\\nGrowth and inclusive development are naturally \\nimportant for all our countries. They require a \\nsupportive international economic environment, \\nenhanced investment flows, including from multilateral \\ndevelopment banks, the transfer of technology, and an \\nopen multilateral trading regime.\\n\\nBut the problems of the more than 1 billion people \\nliving in abject poverty around the world need to be \\nattacked more directly. Poverty remains a major \\npolitical and economic challenge, and its eradication \\nrequires special attention and a new collective thrust. \\nThat priority should anchor the post-2015 development \\nagenda, which should be shaped by the Member States \\nso that it enjoys the broadest possible support and \\nacceptance.\\n\\nIssues of peace, security, human rights and \\ngovernance are important and need to be addressed. But \\nwe will fall short of realizing an ambitious post-2015 \\ndevelopment agenda if we focus merely on governance \\nissues at the cost of robust economic growth. This \\nagenda should not be merely about reprioritizing \\ndomestic spending, but also about fostering genuine \\ninternational partnerships between developing and \\ndeveloped countries to bring about change. All of us \\nneed the policy space necessary to set our own domestic \\npriorities. \\n\\nNo one knows the condition of developing countries \\nbetter than the developing countries themselves. It is \\ntherefore important that the United Nations set clear and \\nconcise goals and provide practical and well-defined \\nmeans of implementation, including an adequate flow \\nof resources and the transfer of technology, taking the \\nviews of developing countries fully into account.\\n\\n\\n\\f\\nA meaningful post-2015 agenda must place equally \\nhigh priority on food and nutrition, health, education, \\ninfrastructure, water, sanitation, energy and combating \\ndiscrimination against women. Especially critical is \\nwomen\\u2019s equal access to economic opportunities and \\nensuring that they do not become victims of violence or \\nthe targets of prejudice.\\n\\nIn India, we have sought to promote inclusive \\ndevelopment in multiple ways. Legislation has broadened \\naccess to education and secured rural livelihoods. We \\nare now building the world\\u2019s largest programme for \\nfood security. Digital technology is being harnessed to \\nimprove the delivery of public services and benefits to \\nthe people.\\n\\nIndia is proud of its partnerships with developing \\ncountries. Using modest resources, we have built strong \\nties with Africa and the least developed countries. We \\nare committed to building 100 institutions in Africa \\nand have offered capacity-building support, including \\nthousands of scholarships, and made available over \\n$9.5 billion of concessional assistance. India and Africa \\nare engaging through the India-Africa Forum Summit \\nprocess. We also look forward to participating actively \\nin the third International Conference on Small Island \\nDeveloping States, to be held in Samoa in 2014, and to \\ncontributing to its outcome.\\n\\nClimate change is one of the defining challenges of \\nour times. We must summon the political will necessary \\nto craft a robust global response to climate change on \\nthe basis of equity and the principle of common but \\ndifferentiated responsibilities.\\n\\nWe are deeply concerned about the future of West \\nAsia, a region with which India shares deep bonds of \\nhistory and one that is critical for our energy security \\nas well as the livelihoods of the nearly 7 million \\nIndians who work and live in the region. Not only is \\nthe increasingly lethal conflict in Syria a tragedy for \\nthe people of Syria, but it also threatens stability and \\nsecurity in the region and beyond. It has been made worse \\nby the use of chemical weapons. The use of chemical \\nweapons, whosoever may have deployed them, must \\nbe condemned in the strongest possible terms. India \\nstrongly supports the elimination of chemical-weapons \\nmaterial and equipment in Syria.There is no military \\nsolution to that conflict. We must intensify efforts to \\nend the conflict and seek a political settlement. It is \\nessential that the \\u201cGeneva II\\u201d conference be convened \\nat the earliest opportunity.\\n\\nWe are encouraged that direct talks have resumed \\nbetween Israel and Palestine. India supports the early \\nrealization of a sovereign, independent, viable and \\nunited State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its \\ncapital, living within secure and recognized borders, \\nside by side and at peace with Israel. We also remain \\ncommitted to the Palestinian quest for full membership \\nin the United Nations.\\n\\nIn our own region, Afghanistan prepares for a \\nhistoric political, security and economic transition. \\nThe international community must support the people \\nof Afghanistan through this transition and beyond in \\ncombating terrorism, preserving the progress of the \\npast decade and creating a stable, united and prosperous \\nAfghanistan.\\n\\nTerrorism remains a grave threat to security and \\nstability everywhere and exacts a heavy toll of innocent \\nlives around the world. From Africa to Asia, we have \\nseen several manifestations of this menace in the last \\nfew days alone. State-sponsored, cross-border terrorism \\nis of particular concern to India, also on account of \\nthe fact that the epicentre of terrorism in our region is \\nlocated in our neighbourhood, in Pakistan.\\n\\nFrom this rostrum yesterday, Prime Minister Nawaz \\nSharif of Pakistan spoke of making a new beginning \\n(see A/68/PV.15). I reciprocate his sentiments and \\nam looking forward to meeting him tomorrow. India \\nis sincerely committed to resolving all issues with \\nPakistan, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, \\nthrough bilateral dialogue on the basis of the Simla \\nAgreement. However, for progress to be made, it is \\nimperative that the territory of Pakistan and the areas \\nunder its control not be utilized for aiding and abetting \\nterrorism directed against India. It is equally important \\nthat the terrorist machinery that draws its sustenance \\nfrom Pakistan be shut down. There must be a clear \\nunderstanding of the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is \\nan integral part of India and that there can never, ever, \\nbe a compromise with the unity and territorial integrity \\nof India.\\n\\nWe need to renew our commitment, especially \\nhere at the United Nations, to concerted, cohesive and \\ncontinuing global action against terrorism. There can \\nbe no tolerance for States sheltering, arming, training or \\nfinancing terrorists. Nor can States absolve themselves \\nof the responsibility to prevent their territories from \\nbeing used to launch acts of terrorism.\\n\\n\\n\\f\\nThe increasingly complex challenges to \\ninternational peace and security require a new \\ninternational consensus to be built, whether it is in the \\nfield of cybersecurity, non-proliferation or terrorism. \\nThis year, 25 years after Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi \\nput forward a comprehensive action plan for a nuclear-\\nweapon-free and non-violent world order, we must \\nstrengthen efforts against nuclear proliferation and \\npursue time-bound, universal, non-discriminatory, \\nphased and verifiable nuclear disarmament. We must \\nalso guard against terrorists and non-State actors \\ngaining access to sensitive materials and technologies.\\n\\nTwo years from now, the United Nations will be \\n70 years old. Every new State born during that period \\nof 70 years has taken its place in the Assembly not just \\nwith pride but also with hope. The year 2015 will be \\na time to celebrate our successes and ensure that the \\nUnited Nations is ready for this century, by completing \\nmuch-needed reforms of the Organization and its \\nSecurity Council, developing an ambitious and balanced \\npost-2015 development agenda and demonstrating our \\ncapacity to cooperate effectively for durable peace and \\nsecurity in the world we live in.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def f_make_text_chunks(raw_txt):\n","\n","    txt = raw_txt.replace('\\ufeff', '')\n","    txt_chunks = re.split('\\.\\s*\\n', txt)\n","    txt_chunks = [txt_chunk.replace('\\n', '') for txt_chunk in txt_chunks]\n","    return txt_chunks\n","\n","\n","def f_chunk_docs(docs):\n","\n","    txt_chunks = []\n","    for doc in docs:\n","        txt_chunks.extend(f_make_text_chunks(doc))\n","    return txt_chunks"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17},"id":"idmhviftkvaJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714789023059,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1565,"user":{"displayName":"sajit sasidharan","userId":"05073885475810025860"}},"outputId":"82436c13-e4c8-4e91-dc22-8bffa6c6a41e"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["idx = 5\n","\n","raw_txt = dff.text.values[idx]\n","txt_chunks = f_make_text_chunks(raw_txt)"],"metadata":{"id":"8y4uiDvIkvXC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714789062667,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":416,"user":{"displayName":"sajit sasidharan","userId":"05073885475810025860"}},"outputId":"c8530bc6-a56b-4a0a-9288-428816119a33"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for i in txt_chunks[:5]:\n","    print(i)\n","    print()"],"metadata":{"id":"IxUk7VvlkvUy","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":755},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714789085634,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":384,"user":{"displayName":"sajit sasidharan","userId":"05073885475810025860"}},"outputId":"e3654eea-c692-4272-d6c3-a1fa34b1035d"},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The United Nations is marking its seventieth anniversary this year, making this session of the General Assembly a historic one. I hope that this year will also be historic for the United Nations in terms of outcomes. I would like to assure the President that he will receive India’s full support in his efforts\n","\n","Seventy years ago, the foundations of the United Nations were laid at the San Francisco Conference, in a city on the west coast of this country. India was one of the signatory countries of the Charter of the United Nations, although at that time we were not independent. We obtained our independence two years later. When the United Nations was established, a rather diminutive-looking man with the powerful weapon of non-violence was writing the final act in a struggle that would become a symbol of hope for the colonized and the oppressed everywhere. I am grateful that the United Nations has proclaimed the birthday of this extraordinary man as the International Day of Non-Violence. It is a pleasing coincidence that tomorrow is 2 October, and42/55 15-29658\f01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22that we will be celebrating his birthday then. Mahatma Gandhi said, “The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world’s problems”. His message is most fitting in the context of the United Nations\n","\n","The seventieth year of any human being’s life is a milestone from which to look back and reflect on what one has achieved and what one has lost. Similarly, for people associated with an institution, the seventieth year provides an opportunity to analyse whether the institution has fulfilled its purpose and achieved the goals set for it at its establishment. Today we need to ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled the purpose and achieved the goals for which the United Nations was established 70 years ago. When I ask myself that question, I receive an affirmative answer for some questions and a negative one for others. For example, the United Nations has been successful in preventing a third world war, assisting decolonization and dismantling apartheid. It has been successful in combating global epidemics, reducing global hunger and promoting democracy and human rights\n","\n","Yet, when we ask ourselves whether we have been able to prevent conflicts taking place in various parts of the world, the answer is “no”. If we ask whether we were able to find permanent solutions to those conflicts, the answer is “no”. If we ask whether we were able to show the path of peace to a world which is treading the path of violence, the answer is “no”. According to those parameters, the United Nations appears to be ineffective at maintaining international peace and security, an institution that has failed to effectively address new challenges in that area\n","\n","Today, the world is ravaged by war on three continents, with the Security Council powerless or unwilling to stem the f low of blood. Traditional solutions that rely on force have only exacerbated problems. We must ask ourselves if we have the political will to craft alternatives to conflict and to pursue them with commitment and single-minded dedication. Nowhere is such a goal more important than in peacekeeping. Under the blue flag, men and women are constantly working to prevent conflict, protect civilians and sustain peace processes. With 180,000 peacekeepers deployed so far, India has been the largest contributor to international security provided by the United Nations. Even today, about 8,000 Indian military and police personnel are participating in 10 peacekeeping missions, operating in highly challenging environments\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"LYdb2pxUR0p6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"uN2iJqSCR0nm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"mjp1LgEtimCU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### CREATING BOW/TFIDF VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS OF DOCS:"],"metadata":{"id":"NqZoTdodmzKM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%%time\n","\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer\n","\n","tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words=stopwords.words('english'), max_df=0.8, min_df=2)\n","bow_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words=stopwords.words('english'), max_df=0.8, min_df=2)\n","\n","tfidf_vectors = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(txt_chunks)\n","bow_vectors = bow_vectorizer.fit_transform(txt_chunks)\n","\n","tfidf_vectors.shape, bow_vectors.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":72},"id":"PqITODY-il_p","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714789168412,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":446,"user":{"displayName":"sajit sasidharan","userId":"05073885475810025860"}},"outputId":"ce46a97d-a1c5-41d3-f77b-f398db187f74"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["CPU times: user 9.26 ms, sys: 860 µs, total: 10.1 ms\n","Wall time: 24.1 ms\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["((26, 216), (26, 216))"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"1n1FoCIlil84"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"kwt2WQ4lmybk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"m0BhPVI-myYb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def f_display_topics(model, vocab, no_top_words=7, n_components=8, max_iter=1000):\n","\n","    try:\n","        text_model = model(n_components=n_components, max_iter=max_iter, random_state=7)\n","    except:\n","        text_model = model(n_components=n_components, n_iter=max_iter, random_state=7)\n","    doc_topic_matrix = text_model.fit_transform(tfidf_vectors)\n","    topic_word_matrix = text_model.components_\n","\n","    for topic, topic_vec in enumerate(topic_word_matrix):\n","        topic_vec = abs(topic_vec)\n","        topic_vec = topic_vec/(topic_vec.sum())\n","        sorted_idx = topic_vec.argsort()[::-1]\n","\n","        print(f'TOPIC {topic+1}:')\n","        print('-----------')\n","\n","        words = []\n","        for i in range(no_top_words):\n","            word = vocab[sorted_idx[i]]\n","            words.append(word)\n","        print(words)\n","        print()\n","        print()\n","\n","    return doc_topic_matrix\n","\n","\n","def f_display_docs(doc_topic_matrix, docs, topic, n_samples = 3, n_top = 10):\n","\n","    cols = [i for i in range(1, doc_topic_matrix.shape[1]+ 1)]\n","    df_topics_docs = pd.DataFrame(doc_topic_matrix, columns = cols)\n","\n","    print()\n","    print('----------------')\n","    top_sorted_idx = df_topics_docs[topic].argsort()[::-1][:n_top]\n","    idxs = sample(list(top_sorted_idx), n_samples)\n","    for i in idxs:\n","        print(docs[i])\n","        print()\n","        print('------------------')"],"metadata":{"id":"CdFqpNUQmNxx","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714789445865,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":431,"user":{"displayName":"sajit sasidharan","userId":"05073885475810025860"}},"outputId":"76e5fa05-2593-4b86-d2cc-e76b38d5ab5e"},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"-E40z0fRmNuY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"zTc3X4LrmNrn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.

Not only have past assurances in this regard not been honoured, but new cross-border terrorist attacks have taken place recently, and two terrorists from across the border have been captured alive.

Today we need to ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled the purpose and achieved the goals for which the United Nations was established 70 years ago. When I ask myself that question, I receive an affirmative answer for some questions and a negative one for others.
