At the very outset let me say how happy I am that the Foreign Minister of the friendly, non-aligned State of Malta is presiding over this session.\\nI must also record our appreciation for the leadership displayed by Major-General Joseph Garba in presiding over the forty-fourth session.\\nI also join other Members of the United Nations in welcoming in our midst the newest Member of the United Nations, Liechtenstein. It gives us special joy also to see a united Yemen in our midst.\\nForty-five years ago India was one of the relatively small number of States that were present at the creation of the United Nations. The United Nations was born of a war-shattered world's hope that it would be the benign, sometimes stern guardian of a world at peace, committed to peace and co-operation between nations. Unfortunately, the end of the Second World War did not bring peace; it brought a long, often icy, cold war. Scores of new nations in Asia and Africa emerged as sovereign States from the crumbling empires of Europe. The cold war had a negative impact on the life of those new nations. We in the so-called third world remained firmly committed to the United Nations as the only organisation that could usher in a truly world-wide peace and promote global well-being. The vicissitudes through which the United Nations passed did not diminish our faith in the Organisation.\\nWe, the nations of the South, have special reason to rejoice at the end of the cold war. India is all the happier because from the very moment of its independence it sought to end the cold war. We joined other nations to enunciate the principles of non-alignment to protect the independence of new nations and their right to choose for themselves the kind of international relations they wished to have and the models of development they wished to adopt. We welcome the collapse of the cold-war divide. I trust that the cold-war mind frame which took deep root during the past 45 years will now yield to the new mind frame of global detente and co-operation.\\nAn event of special importance in this context is the imminent unification of Germany. This will reflect the fulfilment of the deepest aspirations of the German people. In the new Europe which is emerging a united Germany in the model foreseen by a great son of Germany, Thomas Mann, will be a powerful factor in favour of stability and peaceful co-operation. India looks forward to working closely with a united Germany in the cause of peace and progress around the world. \\nIndia always rejected the logic of the cold war and the division of the international community into opposing blocs. In accordance with our policy of non-alignment we sought to build up relations of trust and friendship simultaneously with both the Soviet Union and the United States. The replacement of East-West confrontation by a new co-operative approach has greatly facilitated our task. The past year has seen a further strengthening of our ties with the great democracy of the United States. With our time-tested friend, the Soviet Union, we are adding new dimensions to our friendly co-operation. We hail the historic endeavours of the Soviet people to reshape their political and economic structures on the basis of democracy, unity and economic efficiency.\\nThe United Nations was a participant in many of the momentous changes during the year. Its work in Namibia and Nicaragua provided splendid examples of its role, testifying to its renewed relevance and effectiveness in international affairs, \\u03bb great deal of the credit goes to the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Peres de Cuellar, for his patient, prudent, painstaking and imaginative management of the world body. We wish him and his colleagues continued success in their undertakings.\\nThe Secretary-General perceptively observes in his report on the work of the Organisation this year: 'It has been a wholesome development of recent years that the international discourse has been disburdened of excessive ideological or rhetorical baggage. It is far easier to accommodate contentious interests or claims, honestly stated, than to reconcile opposing doctrines. If the new mood of pragmatism which has released us from the thraldom of the cold war is to spread all over the world, nations need to shed the vestigial prejudices of former times and couch their dialogue in terms of common sense and plain justice. These are truly wise words spoken at a critical turn of history.\\nIndia joins the many nations that now wish to see the United Nations emerge as the pivot and fulcrum of international peace and security. The new effectiveness of the United Rations owes a great deal to the fact that the earlier confrontational relationship between the great Powers gave way to detente, which in turn has led to a new collaborative relationship, \\u03bb co-operative relationship among the major Powers is \\u03b1 necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for true multilateralism. The latter requires the full and equal participation of all nations - big and small - in the multilateral decision-making process. The great issues of the day can no longer be decided in the capitals of a few major Powers. The voice of the majority must not only be heard but also be respected. The democratic principle is an essential requirement of a genuinely multilateral system. Nor can the concerns of the deprived majority of the world's population be denied priority on the international agenda. The new political prestige of the United Nations must be complemented by increased efficacy in other areas, particularly in the economic field. Peace and development are closely interrelated and deserve equal attention. In the final analysis, the success of the United Nations will be measured in terms of its ability to reflect and meet the concerns of the majority of mankind.\\nIndia is gravely concerned at the crisis in the Gulf region. India's position was, and remains, clear and consistent, we are against the use or threat of force in the settlement of differences in inter-State relations. We firmly oppose aggression. The crisis has arisen from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It follows that Iraq must withdraw its forces from Kuwait as demanded by the Security Council. India does not recognise Kuwait's annexation. Kuwait's independence and sovereignty must be restored. Any differences between the two neighbouring States must be resolved exclusively through peaceful means. India fully subscribes to and strictly abide by all the resolutions of the Security Council concerning this crisis. At the same time we maintain that all efforts must be made to achieve a peaceful political resolution of the crisis.\\nThe current crisis has led to the induction of foreign forces into the Gulf region. In the changed world environment, a permanent foreign Military presence is not desires by any country, nor would it be in anyone's interest.\\nFor a very long time India has Maintained the Most cordial and friendly relations with Kuwait and Iraq. Almost 200,000 of our nationals who were present in these countries when the crisis erupted found themselves caught up in its coils. Provision of essential food supplies for the aid other innocent victims fro, third countries is a Matter of the highest importance from the humanitarian point of view, to the entire world community.\\nIn West Asia there can be no durable peace without a just and comprehensive settlement based on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, as well as the right of all States in the region, including Palestine and Israel, to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders, in accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 336 (1973). Israel's attempts to suppress the intifadah or block progress towards a dialogue cannot succeed. A United Nations-sponsored international conference on the Middle East should be convened at an early date.\\nIndia reaffirms its solidarity with the people of Cyprus, part of whose country remains under foreign occupation. We fully support the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of that country. Obstacles have recently been thrown up in the way of the Secretary-General's efforts on Cyprus. The Secretary-General deserves the continuing and full support of the international community in his endeavours. \\nSome of the most hopeful developments during the year relate to southern Africa. Earlier this year we warmly welcomed independent Namibia into this world body. Developments in South Africa hold out promise of real progress. Nelson Mandela, freed after a quarter of a century behind bars, galvanised the currents of peaceful change. We welcome the talks initiated between the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African Government to clear the way for negotiations on a new non-racial constitution. We are concerned, however, at the continuing violence in the townships and the involvement of the South African security forces in the violence. The South African Government must urgently deal with the problem, in order to remove this threat to the process of peaceful change.\\nWhile racism is on the retreat in South Africa, in Fiji a constitution has been imposed which institutionalises racial discrimination. The Suva regime flouts internationally accepted principles of democracy and human rights. Its undemocratic and racially discriminatory policies are unacceptable.\\nIn the Korean peninsula there have been some encouraging signs of reconciliation and dialogue. We regard the recent historic meetings between the Prime Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea as a major step forward. We hope that this process will be further strengthened in future months. We support all efforts aimed at the peaceful reunification of Korea. In conformity with the principle of universality, we further support the aspirations of the Korean people to be represented in the United Nations so that they may actively contribute towards the realisation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations. \\nThere has been encouraging progress towards a resolution of the Cambodian problem. The recent Jakarta meeting and the decision on the Supreme National Council hold out the promise of an early return to normalcy. A settlement of the problem should fully reflect Cambodia's sovereignty and independence and ensure that its people can exercise their democratic right to determine their own destiny free from foreign interference and intervention. In this process the United Nations can and should play an important role.\\nMyanmar continues to hold in thrall by forces unwilling to accept the decision that its people took in the national elections held there in May of this year. We call upon Yangon to accept the people's verdict and work with the latter to establish peace and democracy in that country.\\nRelations with our northern neighbour, the People's Republic of China, have shown a steady and welcome improvement. Both countries have expressed their determination to settle the boundary question through peaceful and friendly consultations and also to develop relations actively in a variety of other fields. In the world where confrontation is giving way to co-operation, friendly co-operation between India and China is all the more important.\\nWe have recently had the honour of receiving the President of Afghanistan in India. His presence in our midst reflected the common desire of both our countries to strengthen further the co-operative and friendly relations that have traditionally existed between them. We believe that full and faithful implementation of the Geneva Agreements so arduously constructed by the Secretary-General will restore normalcy, stabilize the life and security of the Afghan peoples and also help in furthering the cause of peace and good-neighbourliness in South Asia. \\n\\nWe warmly welcome the return of democracy in our neighbouring country, Nepal. Differences that had earlier crept into our relations were happily and speedily resolved after the transition in Nepal, thus reflecting the deep aspirations of the two neighbours.\\t\\nWith the background of the improved inter-State relationships in South Asia, which have been universally welcomed, I would not have taken the time of this body to talk about the aberration pertaining to the bilateral relations between India and Pakistan. In his address my worthy colleague the Foreign Minister of Pakistan has tried to provoke me into an exchange of polemics on issues that are patently internal to India. May I say I will not oblige him.\\nFor more than 8 years now Pakistan has nursed and armed terroristic activities in the Indian State of Punjab. This has caused immense human suffering, Of late Pakistan has chosen to extend those practices to another State of India, Jammu and Kashmir, again resulting in extensive misery and loss of innocent lives. All efforts on our part to persuade the Government of Pakistan to desist from those activities were first ignored and then rejected. Characteristically, Pakistan denied responsibility and involvement in those acts. Now it is trying to justify them on the pretext of support to religious fundamentalism. This, representatives will agree, is against the established principles of international law and good-neighbourliness. The Indo-Pakistan Sheila Agreement signed in 1972 has fully spelled out those principles, and, despite Pakistan's blatant violation, India has continued its quest to build a wholesome relationship of cordiality and friendship that I know the people of our two countries need and desire.\\nThe arms race, support of terrorism and aggressive polemics only add to tensions and create a climate of instability so much out of place in the contemporary global environment. \\nWe have recently proposed to Pakistan a set of measures that would induce confidence and co-operation. But, I say with sadness, Pakistan has chosen to ignore them and to persist in its unacceptable activities. Our two neighbouring countries can have a great future if we respect each other's integrity and unity, and once Pakistan desists from the temptation of interfering in our internal affairs. It is in this spirit that I will not refer to the gross flouting of human rights in Pakistan, particularly in Sind and Baluchistan. To cover up those inhuman acts a duly elected Government has recently been dismissed. But that is Pakistan's internal matter, even though democrats everywhere feel concerned.\\nWe believe that regional organizations have acquired an added relevance and can play an important role in promoting international co-operation. In our region the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation is making a most valuable contribution by fostering a climate of constructive co-operation. We look forward to the steady expansion of its activities, and we do hope that in the coming days Afghanistan and a democratic Myanmar will join that organisation to build an era so much needed in our part of the world.\\nThe reordering of Eastern Europe is epoch making. India welcomes that reaffirmation of the democratic spirit. The changes in that region have understandably prompted the generous instincts of the industrialized world. We hope that Eastern Europe's integration into the world economy will serve the interests of all nations. We look forward to strengthening our ties of co-operation with those countries. At the same time we also expect that the East-West thaw will not result in depriving the developing world of augmented economic assistance.\\nWe have yet to harness effectively the extraordinary opportunities for the success of disarmament efforts created by the sweeping political changes in Europe and in East-West relations. We look forward to the conclusion of a START treaty and an agreement on conventional forces in Europe by the end of this year, as promised. However, those agreements would not justify complacency on the part of the United Nations or international public opinion, as huge arsenals still remain. There is no underlying commitment to give up the doctrine of nuclear deterrence, and avenues for qualitative upgrading of nuclear weapons remain open. Nothing less than a time-bound programme for the elimination of nuclear weapons would sustain a continuous process of deep and substantial reduction until we get rid of the nuclear menace. We also need clear guarantees that the nuclear weapons that are phased out will not be replaced by new, advanced weapons.\\nWith the end of the cold war we feel that now is the time - and a most opportune one - for the international community to question the validity of theories that seek to justify continuation of nuclear weapons. Inter-State relations should be based on co-operation and dialogue instead of mutual fears and frozen hostility. A new international security order needs to be created to prepare us to move towards a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world order outlined within a systematic, rational and practicable time-frame for achieving those objectives.\\nThe positive developments during the past three years since the United Nations Conference on Disarmament and Development have only further vindicated the essential premises of that Conference. Now is the time for seriously exploring the actual ways and means of channelling the peace dividend for the development of the countries of the South that have had to face the adverse economic consequences of the cost of the unprecedented arms build-up in the past decades. The linkage between disarmament and development should remain in the focus of deliberations during the current session. \\nThe immediate priorities during the coming year pertain to negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty, the speedy conclusion of a chemical-weapons convention and the launching of the second phase of reductions in strategic arms with the purpose of eliminating whole classes of those weapons. All nuclear-weapon States must be involved in the negotiations for nuclear disarmament and should be prepared to undertake obligations now. The international community should call upon the nuclear-weapon States to abjure the use of nuclear weapons through an international accord on the non-use of those weapons. Those measures, if they are set in motion, would reflect the far-reaching changes in international relations. \\nEconomic growth during the last year has shown a nixed record, the expansion of world trade and output has begun to slow down. External and fiscal imbalances between the major economies have continued, aggravating the uncertainties that face the developing countries. Monetary instability and higher interest rates have added to the formidable economic problems of those countries. The international economic environment has remained inhospitable, as protectionism and discriminatory trade practices, inadequate financial flows, low commodity prices and exclusion from international economic decision-making have conspired to make developing countries insecure and vulnerable.\\nAs I pointed out earlier, the Iraq-Kuwait crisis worsened this situation by raising oil prices, interrupting oil supplies and, in general, handicapping growth efforts.\\nWhile new problems have arisen, long-standing ones, like external debt, continue to constrain development prospects. Some welcome initiatives have been taken, but they do not appear to be commensurate with the magnitude of the problem. Difficulties of many other countries have been overlooked so far - pointing to the inescapable need for a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problem. Such a solution must include anticipatory measures to prevent further proliferation of the problem to countries that, despite serious difficulties, are continuing to service their debts.\\nAn international development strategy for the next decade is currently being formulated. This period will determine whether the world carries over into the twenty-first century the present legacy of poverty, underdevelopment and stagnation, or whether it embarks on a more productive era, aiming at qualitatively higher levels of human welfare, affording all countries and ell peoples an equitable opportunity to prosper in a stable and predictable external environment. This guiding principle of international co-operation should underlie our efforts in all the sectoral areas of strategy. I hope that we shall be able to conclude negotiations quickly, so that the international community may have before it a coherent and identifiable framework of goals and objectives and a consistent set of policy measures to which all countries stand committed.\\nThe North-South dialogue, once nurtured by the international community, has fallen into a state of neglect. It deserves to be revived. When political co-operation is on the upswing, why should economic co-operation languish? The head and the limbs have to function together if the body is to be strong. India has traditionally had the privilege, in this contest, of working with other countries to make a North-South compact real and forceful.\\nSouth-South co-operation to build up collective self-reliance is an important aspect of international economic growth. The summit, in Kuala Lumpur in June this year, of 15 developing countries, including India, provided significant impetus to this process. Given the political will, much more is possible, and much more should be the aim.\\nWe are now less than 60 days away from the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. A great deal of expectation has been aroused in these negotiations. We have been participating in good faith, in the hope that the conclusions will assist in the development of the developing countries. Despite very severe economic difficulties, many developing countries, including India, have made offers to the limit of their capability. These offers are not, however, being reciprocated - particularly the ones in respect of areas to which developing countries attach importance, such as textiles, agriculture, tropical products and safeguards. It is difficult to visualise a balanced outcome from the Uruguay Round without substantial progress in these and other areas that are of greatest concern to developing countries. \\nEnvironmental concerns have - rightly - moved to the top of the international agenda. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, will be an event of great importance, focusing on the inescapable fact that protection of the environment requires acceleration of development in the poorer countries.\\nAt the heart of the environmental crisis lies the persistence of wide disparities, in levels of production and consumption, between the developed and the developing countries. The very high per capita consumption levels in the industrialized world impose a corresponding strain on global natural resources and thus on the environment. On the other hand, extreme poverty in the developing countries is itself a cause of environmental degradation. In order simply to survive, poverty-stricken people are forced, for example, to cut down forests for firewood or to overgraze pastures.\\nIn the developing countries the environment cannot be protected unless the root cause of its degradation - namely, poverty - is eradicated. Thus sustainable development calls for curbs on extravagant life-styles in affluent countries and for the promotion of economic development in less fortunate areas. 1 should like to add, as parenthesis, that the call for a change in life-styles in affluent societies does not imply a reduction in living standards - indeed, it envisages an improvement in the overall quality of life.\\nIt is now accepted that environmental protection requires the provision of new and additional funds for developing countries, as veil as the transfer of environmentally benign technology to these countries on a preferential basis. Any new environmental regulatory mechanisms should be accompanied, from the outset, by full and adequate provision for funding the technology transfer. This is an absolute requirement for effective action on the environment.\\nIn conclusion, I wish to say that the issues of today are of the utmost importance. We have left behind a long history and have crossed the threshold to another epoch. We have to put our heads and hearts together to design a world of peace and development. We have to fashion the United Nations to reflect the end of the cold war, making it responsive to the diversity of the world community, and representative of world democracy and the equality of sovereign nations. Let the new era usher in world peace and a global fabric of co-operation. Let us all work together towards that noble objective.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

We \\nwish you every success and assure you of our fullest \\ncooperation.\\n\\nAt a time when the world is facing multiple \\nchallenges, there is renewed attention to the role of \\nthe United Nations in advancing international peace, \\nsecurity and prosperity. However, never has scepticism \\nabout the capacity of the United Nations to do so been \\nhigher, or the external environment less propitious for \\nmultilateralism.\\n\\nThe nearly seven decades of work of the United \\nNations hold one simple lesson: that we are most \\nsuccessful when we adhere to the letter and spirit of \\nthe United Nations Charter, basing our decisions on the \\nwidest possible consensus and balancing equitably the \\nneeds and responsibilities of nations at different stages \\nand levels of development.\\n\\nIn those seven decades, the world has changed in \\nfundamental ways. Asia and Africa are independent \\nand resurgent. Countries are now not only more \\ninterdependent, but also face new, increasingly complex \\nchallenges. For multilateralism to remain relevant and \\neffective in the future, multilateral institutions need to \\nbe reformed urgently. The place to begin is right here.\\n\\nThe Security Council must be reformed and \\nrestructured to reflect current political realities. \\nMore developing countries should be included as both \\npermanent and non-permanent members.\\n\\nThe multilateral financial institutions should also \\nenable an enhanced voice for developing countries in \\ntheir decision-making structures. Multilateral efforts \\nmust guide our quest for peace and security, wherever \\nthey are threatened, and the centrality and contribution \\nof the United Nations system to development must be \\nrestored.\\n\\nThose objectives require the building of a new \\ninternational consensus suited to our time and rooted \\nin today\\u2019s realities. It is only such a plan of action that \\nwill enable the United Nations to meet the twin tests of \\nlegitimacy, and effectiveness and efficiency.\\n\\nWe commend your choice of the theme of this \\nsession. Setting the stage for the post-2015 development \\nagenda is especially important as we deal with a \\nlingering global economic slowdown and continuing \\nvolatility in financial markets. These have imposed \\ndisproportionately heavy costs on developing countries \\nand the vulnerable groups within them.\\n\\nGrowth and inclusive development are naturally \\nimportant for all our countries. They require a \\nsupportive international economic environment, \\nenhanced investment flows, including from multilateral \\ndevelopment banks, the transfer of technology, and an \\nopen multilateral trading regime.\\n\\nBut the problems of the more than 1 billion people \\nliving in abject poverty around the world need to be \\nattacked more directly. Poverty remains a major \\npolitical and economic challenge, and its eradication \\nrequires special attention and a new collective thrust. \\nThat priority should anchor the post-2015 development \\nagenda, which should be shaped by the Member States \\nso that it enjoys the broadest possible support and \\nacceptance.\\n\\nIssues of peace, security, human rights and \\ngovernance are important and need to be addressed. But \\nwe will fall short of realizing an ambitious post-2015 \\ndevelopment agenda if we focus merely on governance \\nissues at the cost of robust economic growth. This \\nagenda should not be merely about reprioritizing \\ndomestic spending, but also about fostering genuine \\ninternational partnerships between developing and \\ndeveloped countries to bring about change. All of us \\nneed the policy space necessary to set our own domestic \\npriorities. \\n\\nNo one knows the condition of developing countries \\nbetter than the developing countries themselves. It is \\ntherefore important that the United Nations set clear and \\nconcise goals and provide practical and well-defined \\nmeans of implementation, including an adequate flow \\nof resources and the transfer of technology, taking the \\nviews of developing countries fully into account.\\n\\n\\n\\f\\nA meaningful post-2015 agenda must place equally \\nhigh priority on food and nutrition, health, education, \\ninfrastructure, water, sanitation, energy and combating \\ndiscrimination against women. Especially critical is \\nwomen\\u2019s equal access to economic opportunities and \\nensuring that they do not become victims of violence or \\nthe targets of prejudice.\\n\\nIn India, we have sought to promote inclusive \\ndevelopment in multiple ways. Legislation has broadened \\naccess to education and secured rural livelihoods. We \\nare now building the world\\u2019s largest programme for \\nfood security. Digital technology is being harnessed to \\nimprove the delivery of public services and benefits to \\nthe people.\\n\\nIndia is proud of its partnerships with developing \\ncountries. Using modest resources, we have built strong \\nties with Africa and the least developed countries. We \\nare committed to building 100 institutions in Africa \\nand have offered capacity-building support, including \\nthousands of scholarships, and made available over \\n$9.5 billion of concessional assistance. India and Africa \\nare engaging through the India-Africa Forum Summit \\nprocess. We also look forward to participating actively \\nin the third International Conference on Small Island \\nDeveloping States, to be held in Samoa in 2014, and to \\ncontributing to its outcome.\\n\\nClimate change is one of the defining challenges of \\nour times. We must summon the political will necessary \\nto craft a robust global response to climate change on \\nthe basis of equity and the principle of common but \\ndifferentiated responsibilities.\\n\\nWe are deeply concerned about the future of West \\nAsia, a region with which India shares deep bonds of \\nhistory and one that is critical for our energy security \\nas well as the livelihoods of the nearly 7 million \\nIndians who work and live in the region. Not only is \\nthe increasingly lethal conflict in Syria a tragedy for \\nthe people of Syria, but it also threatens stability and \\nsecurity in the region and beyond. It has been made worse \\nby the use of chemical weapons. The use of chemical \\nweapons, whosoever may have deployed them, must \\nbe condemned in the strongest possible terms. India \\nstrongly supports the elimination of chemical-weapons \\nmaterial and equipment in Syria.There is no military \\nsolution to that conflict. We must intensify efforts to \\nend the conflict and seek a political settlement. It is \\nessential that the \\u201cGeneva II\\u201d conference be convened \\nat the earliest opportunity.\\n\\nWe are encouraged that direct talks have resumed \\nbetween Israel and Palestine. India supports the early \\nrealization of a sovereign, independent, viable and \\nunited State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its \\ncapital, living within secure and recognized borders, \\nside by side and at peace with Israel. We also remain \\ncommitted to the Palestinian quest for full membership \\nin the United Nations.\\n\\nIn our own region, Afghanistan prepares for a \\nhistoric political, security and economic transition. \\nThe international community must support the people \\nof Afghanistan through this transition and beyond in \\ncombating terrorism, preserving the progress of the \\npast decade and creating a stable, united and prosperous \\nAfghanistan.\\n\\nTerrorism remains a grave threat to security and \\nstability everywhere and exacts a heavy toll of innocent \\nlives around the world. From Africa to Asia, we have \\nseen several manifestations of this menace in the last \\nfew days alone. State-sponsored, cross-border terrorism \\nis of particular concern to India, also on account of \\nthe fact that the epicentre of terrorism in our region is \\nlocated in our neighbourhood, in Pakistan.\\n\\nFrom this rostrum yesterday, Prime Minister Nawaz \\nSharif of Pakistan spoke of making a new beginning \\n(see A/68/PV.15). I reciprocate his sentiments and \\nam looking forward to meeting him tomorrow. India \\nis sincerely committed to resolving all issues with \\nPakistan, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, \\nthrough bilateral dialogue on the basis of the Simla \\nAgreement. However, for progress to be made, it is \\nimperative that the territory of Pakistan and the areas \\nunder its control not be utilized for aiding and abetting \\nterrorism directed against India. It is equally important \\nthat the terrorist machinery that draws its sustenance \\nfrom Pakistan be shut down. There must be a clear \\nunderstanding of the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is \\nan integral part of India and that there can never, ever, \\nbe a compromise with the unity and territorial integrity \\nof India.\\n\\nWe need to renew our commitment, especially \\nhere at the United Nations, to concerted, cohesive and \\ncontinuing global action against terrorism. There can \\nbe no tolerance for States sheltering, arming, training or \\nfinancing terrorists. Nor can States absolve themselves \\nof the responsibility to prevent their territories from \\nbeing used to launch acts of terrorism.\\n\\n\\n\\f\\nThe increasingly complex challenges to \\ninternational peace and security require a new \\ninternational consensus to be built, whether it is in the \\nfield of cybersecurity, non-proliferation or terrorism. \\nThis year, 25 years after Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi \\nput forward a comprehensive action plan for a nuclear-\\nweapon-free and non-violent world order, we must \\nstrengthen efforts against nuclear proliferation and \\npursue time-bound, universal, non-discriminatory, \\nphased and verifiable nuclear disarmament. We must \\nalso guard against terrorists and non-State actors \\ngaining access to sensitive materials and technologies.\\n\\nTwo years from now, the United Nations will be \\n70 years old. Every new State born during that period \\nof 70 years has taken its place in the Assembly not just \\nwith pride but also with hope. The year 2015 will be \\na time to celebrate our successes and ensure that the \\nUnited Nations is ready for this century, by completing \\nmuch-needed reforms of the Organization and its \\nSecurity Council, developing an ambitious and balanced \\npost-2015 development agenda and demonstrating our \\ncapacity to cooperate effectively for durable peace and \\nsecurity in the world we live in.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"WnYUVnc1S08D"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"b3_2LCXlS2d5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"kSPZU0UMYl32"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### SAMPLE DATA:"],"metadata":{"id":"VIBqzWFZS2qh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def f_make_text_chunks(raw_txt):\n","\n","    txt = raw_txt.replace('\\ufeff', '')\n","    txt_chunks = re.split('\\.\\s*\\n', txt)\n","    txt_chunks = [txt_chunk.replace('\\n', '') for txt_chunk in txt_chunks]\n","    return txt_chunks\n","\n","\n","def f_chunk_docs(docs):\n","\n","    txt_chunks = []\n","    for doc in docs:\n","        txt_chunks.extend(f_make_text_chunks(doc))\n","    return txt_chunks"],"metadata":{"id":"p_BIkb45FSzT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["idx = 5\n","\n","raw_txt = dff.text.values[idx]\n","txt_chunks = f_make_text_chunks(raw_txt)"],"metadata":{"id":"Jetah5isYdu8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for i in txt_chunks[:5]:\n","    pp(i)\n","    print()"],"metadata":{"id":"mjp1LgEtimCU","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714989709528,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"sajit sasidharan","userId":"05073885475810025860"}},"outputId":"65045809-a45f-418c-c420-2a58f9f900aa"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["('The United Nations is marking its seventieth anniversary this year, making '\n"," 'this session of the General Assembly a historic one.
